_I will be adding a page to show database for debugging_

## Development server

Run `ng serve` inside of the cloned folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build and Deploy

Run `npm run dist` to generate a dist/ folder that holds a (don't laugh) testyo/ folder that can be uploaded to a web server.

## Setup SQL Database
In our case, our main webhost allows us to use phpMyAdmin to create and manage our MySQL database. Currently, we are using Godaddy for testing and protyping. We have included documents in LINK HERE FOR OTHER REPO to be used to recreate our front end if desired.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
